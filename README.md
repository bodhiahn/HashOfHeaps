# HashOfHeaps
This was a project I had last semester that's just a Hash Table of Heaps! (fun to say)
Each data structure is templated, along with using a templated function for the hashing function, so in this example, a Car object is being stored, though given that its a template, data type would work. It's also written to be as efficient as possible, running in log(n) time, and mytest.cpp includes time tests measured in milliseconds.
